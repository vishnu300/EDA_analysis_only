**Customer segmentation** is the process of examining customer attributes and creating groups based on how they behave, who they are, and their specific characteristics. By segmenting customers, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to better meet the specific needs of each group, leading to more effective marketing, increased customer loyalty, and better overall profitability⁷. Here are the key steps for customer segmentation:

1. **Import Libraries**: Begin by importing necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2. **Load the Dataset**: Assuming you have a sample dataset of customer information (e.g., from a CSV file), load it into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Exploration**:
    - Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview.
    - Check data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
4. **Data Visualization**:
    - Plot histograms for numerical variables (e.g., age distribution).
    - Create bar plots for categorical variables (e.g., gender distribution).
    - Use scatter plots to explore relationships between variables (e.g., age vs. income).
5. **Customer Segmentation**:
    - Select relevant features (e.g., age, income).
    - Prepare the feature matrix.
    - Initialize and fit a KMeans clustering model.
    - Assign cluster labels to each data point.
6. **Actionable Results**:
    - Analyze each segment's characteristics (e.g., average income).
    - Devise actionable strategies based on segment insights².
